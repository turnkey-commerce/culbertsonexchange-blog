{{< figure src="/images/sherlock1.jpg" alt="Sherlock at Door" class="right">}}We experienced something yesterday that was reminiscent of that old song from the 80&#8242;s, &#8220;Who Can it Be Now?&#8221;. We heard this subtle noise at the door and thought somebody might be knocking. We went to the door and were surprised to find it was Sherlock, the golden retriever from across the street.

He was waiting patiently at the door, wanting to visit and to get a treat. You have to be careful giving him a treat, though, as he gets pretty eager. 

Sherlock&#8217;s the dog that was famous for borrowing one of Ron&#8217;s shoes from the garage and hiding it in his garage. He&#8217;s a real nice dog with the typical golden retriever laid-back temperament.
