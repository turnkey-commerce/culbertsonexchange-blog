Our temperature dropped down into the low 20&#8242;s last night so I thought our area would be ripe for frost flowers (first freeze of the season, after having had some rain this week. Sure enough there were a bunch of them &#8211; a few right in our back yard! They are very rare and short-lived and a real cool phenomenon of nature. [Frost Flowers on Wikipedia][1]

The last time we saw frost flowers around here was in December 2004: [Christmas Eve 2004 Frost Flowers]({{< relref "2004-12-24-frost-flowers-on-christmas-eve.md" >}}).

Here are some pictures:
