 <img src="images/the_scream.jpg" alt="Scream" align="left" hspace="4" />There have been a rash of ads about &#8220;Adult Attention Deficit Disorder&#8221;, which turns out to be yet another reason for Americans to take some drugs. The TV ads show people in boring business meetings, having a hard time paying attention. That&#8217;s a real big surprise. It&#8217;s just another opportunity for the drug companies to push some drugs on us.

The drug companies even have some quizzes on their website to see if you have Adult ADD: &#8220;Do you have problems wrapping up projects or starting them? Or remembering appointments? Do you put things off? Do you feel overactive? Do you fidget if you must sit for a long time?&#8221;

Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. There&#8217;s a lot going on in these modern times, so it&#8217;s no wonder that people feel that they may have this problem. Meanwhile the drug companies are happy to have you self-diagnose and then have you hassle your doctor to prescribe you these drugs.

&#8220;God damn the pusher man&#8221; indeed.

60 Minutes did a program discussing this on Sunday: [60 Minutes &#8211; ADD Segment][1]

I would continue this article but I&#8217;ve gotten distracted into something else.  <img src="http://www.culbertsonexchange.com/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
