{{< figure src="/images/the_scream.jpg" alt="Scream" class="right">}}There have been a rash of ads about &#8220;Adult Attention Deficit Disorder&#8221;, which turns out to be yet another reason for Americans to take some drugs. The TV ads show people in boring business meetings, having a hard time paying attention. That&#8217;s a real big surprise. It&#8217;s just another opportunity for the drug companies to push some drugs on us.

The drug companies even have some quizzes on their website to see if you have Adult ADD: &#8220;Do you have problems wrapping up projects or starting them? Or remembering appointments? Do you put things off? Do you feel overactive? Do you fidget if you must sit for a long time?&#8221;

Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. There&#8217;s a lot going on in these modern times, so it&#8217;s no wonder that people feel that they may have this problem. Meanwhile the drug companies are happy to have you self-diagnose and then have you hassle your doctor to prescribe you these drugs.

&#8220;God damn the pusher man&#8221; indeed.

60 Minutes did a program discussing this on Sunday: [60 Minutes &#8211; ADD Segment][1]

>Yes. Human beings are way too over-stimulated from the external. Just think about how much of your nervous system/senses, etc. are stimulated while you drive in traffic. Multiply this times TV and everything else in modern life, and you can see why it’s difficult to concentrate on anything for extended periods of time.
