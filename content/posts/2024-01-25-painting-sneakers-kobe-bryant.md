In the [previous post]({{< relref "2024-01-24-painting-sneakers.md" >}}) I discussed how I got into this hobby of painting sneakers by painting shoes in the OSU style to wear for the bowl game.
I also mentioned how our grandson Austin is a big fan of basketball and sneakers -
in particular he wanted shoes that would honor Kobe Bryant.

## Step 1 - Design Kobe Sneakers

We went to Dick's Sporting Goods to buy a pair of white [Nike Air Force 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike_Air_Force#/media/File:Nike_air_Force_1_white_on_white.jpg). Then I took pictures of the shoes to
use for design on the computer on the Paint.net application.

Austin wanted to include the jersey numbers that Kobe had with the Lakers, with 8 on the outside
sides of both shoes and 33 on the back. He also wanted Kobe's high-school number 24 on the inside sides of the shoes. For the front he wanted the black mamba logo. The Lakers colors of purple and yellow
were to be used.

The final design looked like this:

**Note:** The colors in the design are a little bleached out because they were added as a
top layer that was at a reduced opacity to allow the background patterns of the shoe stitching
to show through. Also, the final implementation the numbers on the purple background were changed
to white for better contrast.

### Step 2 - Prepare Surface and Tape

The shoes were prepared similarly as described in the
[previous post]({{< relref "2024-01-24-painting-sneakers.md#step-2---prepare-surface-and-tape" >}}),
by first treating with acetone (nail polish remover), and then masking all of the parts that
wouldn't be painted purple with green painter's tape.

Sneakers after surface prep and masking:

### Step 3 - Paint the Colors

The shoes were first air-brushed purple in three coats. Then the tape was removed to reveal the
unpainted parts:
