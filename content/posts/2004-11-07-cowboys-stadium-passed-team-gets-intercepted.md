It was probably inevitable, but the Dallas Cowboys stadium initiative [passed in Arlington last week][1]. This corporate welfare will be paid by the taxpayer and the majority of the benefit will go to Jerry Jones and associates. To the credit of the opposition, [they put up a good campaign against it][2] and kept the voting close.

The stadium will be paid for by an increase in the local sales tax and the other usual suspects (rental car and hotel taxes). These taxes are well known to anyone that travels to Houston and takes a look at their hotel or rental car bill. Hopefully in the long run it will keep conventions and other type business out of these cities.

In the mean time most of the people that voted for this in Arlington probably won&#8217;t be able to affortd the exhorbitant prices of the tickets anyway. They are helping to line Jerry Jones pocket with very little benefit in return.

Maybe the Cowboys management should spend as much attention on the team as on their stadium initiative, as they are in the middle of a losing season full of taxing interceptions.
