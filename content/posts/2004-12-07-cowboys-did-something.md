I was really impressed by the rookie Julius Jones on the Monday Night Game last night. I even stayed up for the whole game and was rewarded by an unbelievable comeback by Dallas.

He will help the offense a bunch by finally providing a credible running threat.

Some notes on the Monday night coverage by Michaels:

  * He kept going on about the receiver (Keyshawn) being out of the endzone on the touchdown that got Dallas back in the game with a couple of minutes left. They kept playing the replay over and over to analyze whether his elbow hit out of bounds before his foot was in. They missed the obvious fact that he was pushed out which made the elbow position a moot point.
  * He kept saying that somebody on Seattle should have called a fair catch on the onside kick. The problem with that is that the ball had bounced right after the kick and as far as I know you can&#8217;t call fair catch once the ball hits the ground (great kick by the Dallas kicker by the way). The better commentary would have been about how poor the Seattle special team was in covering the kick. Whitten recovered it in the air and wasn&#8217;t even challenged.

Overall it was a great game. First NFL game I&#8217;ve watched all the way through in a long time.
