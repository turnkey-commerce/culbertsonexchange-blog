We bought a couple of ceiling fans for our covered back patio and set about the
task of installing them to replace the light fixtures in the ceiling. Some of the
work was more challenging than expected as it can be on these types of projects.
The ceiling fan that we chose was the
[Hampton Bay Cedar Lake](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Hampton-Bay-Cedar-Lake-44-in-Indoor-Outdoor-LED-Matte-Black-Damp-Rated-Ceiling-Fan-with-Light-Kit-Downrod-and-4-Reversible-Blades-52109/314459847),
mainly because the blades and airflow are suitable for the smaller area, it is
rated for outdoor covered usage, and the light fixture looks cool:

### Removing Existing Fixture and Electrical Box

First of all power was cut from the circuit at the switch box.
Then the original light fixture had to be removed:

which revealed a plastic electrical box, which is OK for light fixtures but totally
inadequate for a ceiling fan:

These types of boxes need to be replaced by something rated to support a ceiling fan such
as a metal box supported by some structure between the ceiling joists. But first the
existing box needed to be removed which was somewhat difficult because it is nailed to
a joist from the side by two nails. I used a long piece of wood and hammered it upward
to push the box up until it broke.  I was then able to remove the nails and the rest
of the box.

### Installing New Electrical Box Brace Kit

Since there is no way to do the assembly of a bracing from above the key is to install
it from below using a ceiling fan brace kit and I found a
[brace kit from Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-4-in-Round-1-1-2-in-Deep-15-3-cu-in-Metallic-Ceiling-Fan-Light-Fixture-Box-and-Brace-Kit-for-Old-New-Work-CMB150-OB/205383178)
that did the trick and looks like this:

![Electrical Box Brace Kit](/images/electrical-box-brace-kit.jpg "Electrical Box Brace Kit")

The angular legs at each end of the kit stand on the sheet rock and the square-shaped
brace is turned to expand the brace. There are barbs at the end of the legs that grab
to the studs on both sides of the hole as the tension is tightened and the brace is centered
over the hole as such:

Then the electrical fixture box is hung from the brace and the wiring is run through two
holes in the box.  In this case there was two sets of wires as the house wiring is relaying
the power to the second light in the patio ceiling.

### Installing the Ceiling Fan

The first step was to install the ceiling fan mount to the braced electrical box that
was installed in the previous section:

![Ceiling Fan Mount Installed](/images/ceiling-fan-mount.jpg "Ceiling Fan Mount Installed")

Then the blades are attached to the motor assembly which is then attached to the ceiling
fan mount:

![Ceiling Fan Motor Assembly Installed ](/images/ceiling-fan-motor-assembly-hung.jpg "Ceiling Fan Motor Assembly Installed")

Next the house wiring is attached to the motor assembly wiring and the canopy is attached
to the ceiling fan mount to hide everything:

Finally the light kit is installed to complete the installation:

![Ceiling Fan Light Kit Installed ](/images/ceiling-fan-light-kit-installed.jpg "Ceiling Fan Light Kit Installed")

This particular model ceiling fan won't work until the light kit is installed so it
was now ready for testing. The power was then restored to the circuit and the ceiling
fan was tested and worked well.

### Painting Ring Left by the Original Light Fixture

There was a ring of unpainted sheet rock around the fan canopy, which was the area that had
been covered by the original light fixture (see image above). The challenge here was to
match the ceiling paint because we didn't have the original paint nor its specification.

#### Getting Paint Chip and Color Matching

Using an X-ACTO knife I cut a dime-size paint chip near the fan from the outside paper
part of the sheet rock. I took it to the local Sherwin Williams paint store and they used
a scanning device to do a color match and sold me a quart of the matched paint.
After painting the area I noticed the color match was close but the sheen was off:

![Ceiling Color Match Before ](/images/ceiling-color-match-before.jpg "Ceiling Color Match Before")

In the more lighted areas of the above image it's apparent that the sheen is different.
The paint is a flat sheen, but the original paint has a satin sheen, which appears as
a mismatch in color. When I got the matched paint at Sherwin Williams I assumed they also
matched the sheen of the paint but when I returned to the store it was pointed out that
the system doesn't match the sheen.

I got a new can of matched paint with a satin sheen and then repainted and the match was
then perfect:

The conclusion of the color match challenge was to be careful to specify the correct sheen
when ordering the paint, although that may not always be easy until the paint is laid down.

### Conclusion

The installed ceiling fans look good and deliver a nice airflow smoothly and quietly. The
biggest challenges in the project were the removal of the old electrical box, the installation
of the braced electrical box, and the matching of the existing paint to finish the project.
The ceiling fan itself was easy to install thanks to the nice
the "QuickFit" installation provided by Hampton Bay fans.
