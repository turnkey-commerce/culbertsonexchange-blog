Memorial Day is a day to remember the sacrifices that the men and women in our armed forces make for our liberty. Since April 1775, the soldiers of America have fought and died for an abstract but important concept of &#8220;liberty&#8221;. At the time of those initial revolutionary battles the concept was not so abstract to the people as they had directly experienced being under a government that did not provide basic freedoms or due process for its citizens. A revolution was fought and won and a few years later an important document was written to guarantee that these hard-won freedoms would endure.

Since that time [over half a million Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice][1] while fighting for freedom at home and abroad. Most of them died young and their loss left but an enduring memory for their family and community. They went to war not without fear, yet they went and served honorably.

At this time it is also important to remember that as citizens we have a duty to honor these sacrifices by staying vigilant at home. These hard-won freedoms should not be relinquished in the name of &#8220;safety&#8221; or any other reason. Therefore we must keep a watchful eye on our government and let them know in no uncertain terms when they would disregard the Constitution for temporary power or safety. Do not let them desecrate the sacred honor of these brave Americans.
