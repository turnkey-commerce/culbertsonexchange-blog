Extending on the theme of value from the web (<a href="http://www.culbertsonexchange.com/wp/?p=8" target="wiki">Wikipedia post</a>), I checked out the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net/" target="guten">Project Gutenberg</a> website, and found that they have a great quantity of classic books that you can download for free to your computer or Palm Pilot.
  


### 

Most people don&#8217;t like to read books from the computer and it&#8217;s difficult to &#8220;curl up to your computer&#8221; in bed (unless you have some Michael Jackson tendencies). However, the new <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/handhelds/tx/" target="palm">Palm Pilots</a> with the higher resolution screens have changed that. The eReader application makes it possible to read from the screen in a package smaller than a &#8220;pocket book&#8221;. Plus they come with their own backlight so you can &#8220;curl up to your Pilot&#8221; without turning the lights on. They&#8217;ve also come down in price and probably could be acquired at a great price used.
