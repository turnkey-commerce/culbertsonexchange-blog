The first taker was [a lady in Dallas][2] that paid $50,000 for a clone of her cat. It makes perfect sense that the first case was from Dallas. I can picture her at the Junior League meeting, telling her colleague, &#8220;Well Buffy, I guess **your** cat will have to be content with being stuffed.&#8221;

I imagine that 50K could have helped sterilized a few cats, and keep some real ones out of the pound.

Don&#8217;t let Jerry Jones hear about this or he&#8217;ll be demanding a sample jar from Aikman.

Now if we could tax both cloning and Botox, the country could get out of this deficit thing, just from Dallas and LA alone&#8230;
