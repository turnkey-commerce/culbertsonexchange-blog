![Jack O' Lantern Mushrooms][1]
  
We had an interesting occurrence over Halloween. We saw these striking orange-colored mushrooms growing out of the stump of a dead tree. They probably came out as a result of all of the rain we&#8217;d gotten in October. I took the picture of them and then [read more about them on the Internet][2]. 

The interesting thing is that they supposedly glow in the dark. The area under the gills is supposed to glow a faint green. I took a piece of one into the closet and after allowing our eyes to adjust didn&#8217;t see it glow. Evidently you need to get them when they are fresher. It did seem kind of silly looking at a mushroom in the closet.

Didn&#8217;t try to eat them, by the way. These mushrooms will make you **very** sick.

[This writer had the same results as I did][3] trying to observe the glowing mushrooms.
