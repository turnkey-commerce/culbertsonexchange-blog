<img src="images/saucer.jpg" alt="Flying Saucer" align="left" border="5" style="border-color:white;" />We&#8217;ve been watching some of those old _Twilight Zone_ classics and have been amused by some of the ways in which space travel was envisioned back in the early 60&#8242;s. There seems to have been an assumption that we would be traveling around in flying saucers. This was likely brought on by the fascination with flying saucers around that time and in the 1950&#8242;s classics (e.g. &#8220;[The Day the Earth Stood Still][1]&#8220;).

The funny thing about this is that a flying saucer isn&#8217;t a very good configuration for a space craft. The shape might look good for aerodynamics, but doesn&#8217;t make much sense in the vacuum of space. Most actual spacecraft for interplanetary travel have been anything but aerodynamic (check out the [LEM from the Apollo program][2]). 

For a really long flight it would be advantageous to have even bulkier and less-aerodynamic configurations &#8211; to use space effectively and to help block radiation. Also something shaped like a wheel or barbell could be used to simulate gravity by rotation. It&#8217;s just highly unlikely that a saucer would be anyone&#8217;s final design.
