Our grandson loves basketball and is seriously into shoes and I thought
it would be cool to paint him some custom sneakers.  I saw some videos on YouTube
that gave some
[tips and tricks for painting shoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scD96zyvu_k&t=367s),
as well as some videos about
[which paint to use and how to prepare the shoes for painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yauu5kcSvc).

## First Project - OSU Shoes

Before diving in too deeply I thought it would be a good idea to practice by painting
some shoes that I could wear to the Texas Bowl where my alma-mater Oklahoma State would
be playing Texas A&M right after Christmas.
So I bought some inexpensive Walmart sneakers, took a picture of them, and then prototyped a
design using the Paint.net program:
