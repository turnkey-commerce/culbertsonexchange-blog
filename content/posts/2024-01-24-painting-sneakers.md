Our grandson loves basketball and is seriously into shoes and I thought
it would be cool to paint him some custom sneakers.  I saw some videos on YouTube
that gave some
[tips and tricks for painting shoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scD96zyvu_k&t=367s),
as well as some videos about
[which paint to use and how to prepare the shoes for painting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Yauu5kcSvc).

## First Project - OSU Shoes

Before diving in too deeply I thought it would be a good idea to practice by painting
some shoes that I could wear to the Texas Bowl where my alma-mater Oklahoma State would
be playing Texas A&M right after Christmas.

### Step 1 - Get Shoes and Design

I bought some inexpensive Walmart sneakers, took a picture of them, and then prototyped a
design using the Paint.net program:

**Note:** The colors in the design are a little bleached out because they were added as a
top layer that was at a reduced opacity to allow the background patterns of the shoe stitching
to show through.

### Step 2 - Prepare Surface and Tape

The surface that was going to be painted was scrubbed with a cotton face pad
soaked with nail polish remover. That removes the factory finish and allows the
leather paint to adhere better. It is also recommended to lightly sand the surface
although I didn't do that for this project.

The areas that weren't going to be painted were masked with green painters tape
(Scotch #2060). Then I also masked the areas that were to be painted orange since I
was painting gray first.

### Step 3 - Paint the Colors

It's recommended to paint a base coat but for this project I just laid down multiple
coats of the final color. First I painted
the gray areas with an airbrush, first coat being a light one to establish the base.
In between I used a hair drier to help the paint dry faster.

After three coats of the gray I removed the mask from the large orange area and masked the
gray areas. Then I repeated the process for the large area with the airbrush for three
coats. For the small orange area I hand-painted it with a brush.

The paints I used for this step were
[Angelus Orange Acrylic Leather Paint](https://www.amazon.com/Angelus-Brand-Acrylic-Leather-Resistant/dp/B00B8BSUOS) and
[Angelus Gray Acrylic Leather Paint](https://www.amazon.com/Angelus-Acrylic-Leather-Paint-Grey/dp/B0196T9XVC).

### Step 4 - Paint the Finisher Coats

For the final finisher I sprayed three coats of the
[Angelus Acrylic Matte Finisher](https://www.amazon.com/Angelus-Brand-Acrylic-Leather-Finisher/dp/B00B5W4LX4).
This protects the finish and also tones down the shine a bit.

### Step 5 - Logo

For the logo I made several attempts at making a stencil and then
spraying the black paint over it. The practice runs were on an old
shoe and they turned out unsatsifactory due to overspray. There
were some premade stencils online but weren't the correct size.
I finally just bought a premade sticker online and used that which
was an OK compromise since these shoes where only for occasional wear.

### Final Result

The final result wasn't bad for a first effort and I learned some
techniques along the way:

On the "Kobe Bryant" shoe project I did after this one I learned a lot about
making the stencils for a logo and may make a run at redoing the logo for these
shoes to replace the sticker.
