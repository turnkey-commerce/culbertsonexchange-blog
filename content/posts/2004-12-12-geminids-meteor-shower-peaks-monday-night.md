The Geminids meteor shower should put on a good show Monday night (12/13/04), so check it out if you can. It will appear to emanate from the Gemini constellation which is to the left of the familiar Orion constellation. Around 10:00 pm CST Gemini will be to the east-northeast, about 30 degrees up in the sky. See the star map below as a guide to viewing.

Saturn is also visible just below Gemini. It&#8217;s at a good angle to view the rings if you have a good scope.

Be sure to dress warm as we will have some cool weather.
