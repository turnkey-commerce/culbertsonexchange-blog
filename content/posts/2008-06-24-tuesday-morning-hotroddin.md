I previously [wrote about how much I like wild rides][1], and my friend Mike was kind enough to take me out for a fun ride in his newly rebuilt &#8217;72 Nova hot rod this morning. And by rebuilt I mean the engine has been transformed to a monster, as in &#8220;**It&#8217;s aliiiiiiive!!**&#8220;. The engine&#8217;s displacement is 496 cubic inches and horsepower has been estimated at 700 BHP. When started it often sets off car alarms and scares any nearby kids and elderly. When being built I nicknamed it &#8220;The Big Dig&#8221; (from boring out the cylinders), and it is now known as &#8220;Brutus Maximus&#8221;. It was a lot of fun to ride in, when he put the pedal down it was like a speedboat taking off as it reared up trying to pop a wheely. I noticed there were some hand prints on the dash from previous riders holding on! The prints weren&#8217;t from my hands but Mike says I was holding on to the seat pretty tightly ;).

>Actually the 496 was the displacement, the HP was estimated at 700, but hasn’t been measured on a dyno.
