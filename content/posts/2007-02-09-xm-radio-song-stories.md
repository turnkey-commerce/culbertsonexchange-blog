Cheryl gave me an [XM Satellite Radio][1] player for my birthday and it&#8217;s been one of those gifts that keep on giving. It was pretty easy to install in the car, the only trouble was running the wire from the antenna (placed on the roof near the back hatch) to the dash area. It has quite a few news, sports, and talk stations but I was mainly interested in it for the music and it thankfully that makes up the majority of the stations. The last thing I want to hear is some blowhard like Limbaugh giving his force-fed opinions to a bunch of ditto-heads or Stern salivating over the latest bimbo.

In fact there are 15 different channels dedicated to rock and 5 dedicated to jazz and blues. I had to go on a business trip to Houston recently and it made the long drive pleasant. The most pleasant surprise actually turned out to be a talk show of sorts, a program called &#8220;Song Stories by Graham Nash&#8221;. In this program Graham, of &#8220;Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young&#8221; fame, interviews songwriters about their songwriting process and stories about the important songs they&#8217;ve written. The most interesting topics on his program were his interviews with Grace Slick, David Crosby, and Carole King. Very good stuff indeed. You can hear excerpts of it on the web at this link: [Song Stories by Graham Nash][2].
