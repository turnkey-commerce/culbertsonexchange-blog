Gravity has been one of the bigger mysteries to man. Isaac Newton&#8217;s attempts to understand it spawned a new branch of mathematics and a better understanding of mechanics. Einstein explored it in his unified field theory and warned others to stay away from such a tough problem.

One concept that is interesting is &#8220;What is the speed of gravity?&#8221;. In a thought experiment, if something very massive suddenly appeared in the vicinity of Pluto&#8217;s orbit, would it take four hours for the Sun&#8217;s gravity to have an effect on its motion (four hours is the amount of time light takes to get to Pluto from the Sun) or would it be near instantaneous? The Sun&#8217;s field is already &#8220;there&#8221; but the Sun is also affected by the gravity of the planet &#8211; it is a two-way interaction &#8211; which is the basis of some of the string theories that try to explain how these fields are &#8220;communicated&#8221;.

Of course this thought experiment is impossible in the real world but could the speed of gravity be faster than light? And how does gravity work over vast interstellar distances? It obviously has an effect as observed in intersecting galaxies in the Hubble picture above. Maybe re-examining the role of gravity in the cosmos could better explain some of the strange effects, such as the expanding universe, that have been attributed to &#8220;dark matter&#8221; or &#8220;dark energy&#8221;.

Some of the ideas on the speed of gravity are explored in this website:
