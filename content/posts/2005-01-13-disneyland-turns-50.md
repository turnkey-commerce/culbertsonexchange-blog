{{< figure src="/images/disneylandpalace.jpg" alt="Disneyland Palace" class="right">}} I remember going to Disneyland with the family in the early 60&#8242;s. We had a lot of fun &#8211; the [old mine train ride][1] that went (slowly) around the desert area with geysers and then went through the cave &#8211; and the classic jungle boat ride with the corny jokes told by the &#8220;captain&#8221;. The park was only a few years old at the time and it&#8217;s now celebrating it&#8217;s 50th year in operation.

A lot of the old rides like the mine train have been replaced. There&#8217;s a [nice site called Yesterland][2] that recalls all of the old discontinuded rides and attractions, as well as sharing stories from guests and employees. 

The site brought back a lot of good memories and even the only bad one &#8211; the time I fell off the stool at the [Carnation Ice Cream Parlor][3].
