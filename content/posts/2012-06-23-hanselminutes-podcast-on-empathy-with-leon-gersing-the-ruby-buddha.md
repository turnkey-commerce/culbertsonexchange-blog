Scott Hanselman recently published a really great podcast on his always-good _Hanselminutes_ show, “[On Empathy with Leon Gersing the Ruby Buddha][1]”.&nbsp; They discuss how important it is to maintain empathy when dealing with others on the Internet as well as in real life, and the importance of keeping a direct connection to your end customers and colleagues in your community. It should be required listening for those in the software industry.
