The main density of rainfall walked right up I-35 in what the weathermen call a “train” effect. Then again on September 8 a second load of rain was pulled up from the gulf by the tail of the storm. Unfortunately the ground was still drenched from the previous rain and it <a href="http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/local/flooding-at-kyle-and-wimberley" target="_blank">resulted in some flooding in our area</a>. The bad thing about flooding in this area are the low-water crossings that people will sometimes try to drive through. In some subdivisions the flooded crossings also trap people so they can’t leave or get back to their house.

There’s a normally-dry creek bed in the ravine behind our house. This afternoon it was a river that we could hear loudly raging from the house.  I walked down to the area of the creek and captured some video of the flooding:
