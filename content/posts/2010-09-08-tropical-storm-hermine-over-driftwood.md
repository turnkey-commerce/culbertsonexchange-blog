We were visited by the “dirty” (west) side of [Tropical Storm Hermine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Hermine_(2010)) on September 7 which dumped some significant rainfall on us. The main density of rainfall walked right up I-35 in what the weathermen call a “train” effect. Then again on September 8 a second load of rain was pulled up from the gulf by the tail of the storm. Unfortunately the ground was still drenched from the previous rain and it [resulted in some flooding in our area](http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/local/flooding-at-kyle-and-wimberley). The bad thing about flooding in this area are the low-water crossings that people will sometimes try to drive through. In some subdivisions the flooded crossings also trap people so they can’t leave or get back to their house.

There’s a normally-dry creek bed in the ravine behind our house. This afternoon it was a river that we could hear loudly raging from the house.  I walked down to the area of the creek and captured some video of the flooding:
