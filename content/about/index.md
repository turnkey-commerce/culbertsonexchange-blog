Welcome to James Culbertson&#8217;s blog. James is an independent software consultant who lives in the hill country of Texas with Cheryl, Gus, Gracie, and Stanley. The image at the top is Beale Street in Memphis where we had a lot of fun back in September 2007. The image below is a wildflower that grew on our property in 2004.
